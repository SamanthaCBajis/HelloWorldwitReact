    <!-- Starts with component called Hello and the one method we are using in render -->

    <!-- In render is where the description of what React will make on the page, will be Hello World -->

    <!-- ReactDOM.render() will render this to the screen and will connect the Hello component to the id="root" -->

    <!-- Props and State are two types of React data - State is private and can be changed within the component.  -->
    
    <!-- Props are external and not controlled by the component. Props is passed down from components higher up the hierarchy and those that control the data -->

    <!-- Big thing in React is reusing a component in different cases, like displaying different messages in this case - passing Props to the component will do this -->

    <!-- Prop is called message and has value of "my friend" and it is accessed in the Hello component by referencing this.props.message - written within { } because we want to tell JSX that we want to add a JavaScript expession (called escaping) -->

    <!-- To change the data (the message) we have to use state. If you want the data in app to change, ex. based on user interactions must be stored in a components state -->

    <!-- this.state initializes the state. The state in an object within the constructor and has one key called message - super() in the constructor is used because this is uninitialized before super() has been called -->

    <!-- this.setState() called by passing in as arguement to updateMessage method -->

    <!-- then button is added to render() method to trigger the updateMessage method - hooking eventlistender onto the button and is listening for onClick event and when it happens will call updateMessage method which calls this.setState() that changes the this.state.message value -->
